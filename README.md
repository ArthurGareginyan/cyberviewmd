## Description

CyberViewMD is a macOS application designed for previewing Markdown files. It provides an easy and efficient way to view your Markdown documents without the need for editing functionalities. Developed using the Electron framework, CyberViewMD aims to offer a streamlined user experience for developers, writers, and anyone who frequently works with Markdown files.

## Why This Project Exists
